# Horiseon Code Refactor Homework

##Summary
In this project I took the provided code and reformatted it to follow semantic html and also took the existing css and consolidated it and reordered it to follow the semantic html. This repository shows a few of the version of code that I went through to get from what was provided the "before code" to the "final" edited code. 

##Description
The main focus for this project was to take the already existing code and change it/modify it to follow accessibility standards. I did this by taking the code and changing many of the <div> elements to follow a proper page format. 
  
##Process  
Specific changes I made to the code as changing the first <div> element into a header which encompassesed the name of the company and the 3 links at the top of the page
I changed the second <div> eleemnet into a navigation bar so that users could easily find and click on the links to the 3 sections of the website.
The main information on the webpage was formatted in 3 sections one for  SEO, online reputation, and social media marketing, but each one was a seperate <div> that I chnaged to a <section> tag.
A section on the side of the website provided additional information on the benefits of SEO that were not directly related to the other sections so I changed that into an <aside> tag.
A footer at the bottom of the page that contions the copyright was also modified. 
Once I had changed all the html to follow semanitc guidlines I worked on fixing broken links and making changse that allowed for better accessibility. One of those was adding alt attributes to all the <img> tags as they were missing. The one expection was the background picture.
A title was also added as it was not included in the original source code. Along with some keywords to promote better SEO. 
All these changes lead to better accessibility for anyone not viewing the webpage in a traditional way. I.e. using a screen reader or only using a keyboard to navigate the page. 
I built this project to learn how to format semantic html and better understand what good/clean code looks like and acts like. Also needed make sure the css matched the flow of html was a good way to set up future relationships between html and css.
One of the more challenging aspects of the code was the comments. What makes a good comment vs. a useless one. Good clean code is often easy to follow and so comments must be well thought and add value to the code for anyone reading it. Other challenges included navigating git. This project was very useful in getting the flow of how to pull code then add and push commits to GitHub.
INSALLATION
Describe links why comments are the way they are and how they help understand the code.
